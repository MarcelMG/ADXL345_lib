# ADXL345 driver examples
 * **activityDetection** - This example shows how to put the ADXL345 and the main microcontroller in sleep mode and use the ADXL345's activity detection feature to trigger an interrupt which wakes up the microcontroller when the device detects a motion above threshold
 * **readValues** - this example shows the basic usage, reading acceleration values and calculating inclination and printing them
